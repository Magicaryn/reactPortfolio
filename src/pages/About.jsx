                      Welcome to my Portfolio!! I am a student in the coding bootcamp at northwestern university.
                       This is my first time attempting development or working with data in this fashion. I have come
                        from many years of management in the restaurant industry and never had a technical background other
                         than self taught endeavours. I really enjoyed working with sql databases as i have always been a huge
                         fan of spreadsheets and i also would love to learn and practice more with UI/UX
