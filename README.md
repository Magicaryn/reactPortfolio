# reactPortfolio
my new portfolio made with react and deployed on netlify.

This portfolio is made using react to create a quick loading interface. you can easily move between each page using the nav bar at the top. selecting about will bring you to the home page which is my bio. the contact page will allow you to send a message to me. the portfolio link will show you a few of the apps i helped create. and my resume page gives you a quick view and a dowload button for my resume.
